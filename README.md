Task 3 - Calculator
This calculator website has been made using HTML and CSS with a little touch of Bootstrap (utilizing its classes to make things easier).

Template I followed (not completely): https://freedesignresources.net/free-calculator-ui-template/ <br>
🍃 Resources I used:

1. CSS box shadow: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp
2. Buttons - Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/
3. Flex - Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/
